  A framework for simulating CMB space telescope data, and estimation and correction of systematic effects in time-domain
</p>

## Features

* Simulate realistic TODs for a Core/LiteBIRD-like CMB space telescope
* Injecting systematics such a bandpass mismatch, beam asymmetry, pointing errors among others
* A fast high-resolution convolution technique in time-doamin for main beams of any shape
* Control of individual detectors in the simulation
* A fast maximum-likelihood destriping map-maker for estimation and correction of systematic effects
